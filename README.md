# OpenCV_Proj_AKI
C0DEA and Emre worked as a team on this Project for the Module: Angewandte KI by Mr. Buono

What you need to run this:
- Python (With pip)
- IDE (Preferably VIsual Studio Code)
- OpenCV. If youre on Windows just do "pip install opencv-python"
- The XML file and The python code you want to run (1 .py file is enough to run)

The two XML files are from the "OpenCV" Repo

Majority of the Code was written ChatGPT. It made the development more efficient and simpler. 

OpenCV_FACECOUNTER_FPS.py is the most up to date version, the rest are older versions or testing "environments".

"Embrace the GPT or the GPT will embrace you"
