# OpenCV_Proj_AKI
Me and Emre worked as a team on this Project for the Module: Angewandte KI by Mr. Buono

What you need to run this:
- Python (With pip)
- IDE (Preferably VIsual Studio Code)
- OpenCV. If youre on Windows just do "pip install opencv-python"
- The XML file and The python code you want to run (1 .py file is enough to run)

The two XML files are from the "OpenCV" Repo:
https://github.com/opencv

I tried to enable CUDA, but it was way too complicated. I asked my professor, Mr. Buono, checked YouTube, and also asked ChatGPT. Apparently, the only solution is to recompile the OpenCV library using CMake and import it into the project. I tried to do it, but at some point, it took too much time since I also had exams to study for, so I had to settle for the CPU version.
I’m planning to run this on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano once I get my hands on one. If I had to develop facial detection software again, I would go the YOLO route. OpenCV also seems a little outdated (check the last commits on their repo).

Applied AI is cooler than I thought, and I’m looking forward to creating more cool stuff. 

### OpenCV_FACECOUNTER_FPS.py is the most up to date version, the rest are older versions or testing "environments". ###
### WHEN RUNNING THE PROGRAM PRESS "Q" TO QUIT IT###
Majority of the Code was written ChatGPT. It made the development more efficient and simpler.
