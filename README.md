What you need to run this:
- Python (With pip)
- IDE (Preferably VIsual Studio Code)
- OpenCV. If youre on Windows just do "pip install opencv-python"
- The CSV file and The python code you want to run (1 .py file is enough to run)

Majority of the Code was written ChatGPT. It made the development more efficient and simpler.
